Feedback on scraping/data cleaning blog post (first blog post, draft SHA 0daa00b8d9fea88ceb7f4e4bcd0a1b6d4c3ae2cf):

Jackson Passey: The post looks really good, I like how succinct and laid out the steps are. 
    My one improvement for you would be to change the header photo if possible -- something 
    more related to the project like snow rather than a computer.
Response: Switched out the header photo for something more appropriate.

Nate Mohun: Looks great, my only suggestion is to increase the size of some of the images, 
    they are kind of hard to see without zooming in a bunch.
Response: Resized the images to be more readable.

Garrett Springer: Looks good, but you should include a link to your data and code repository
    for the project.
Response: Added a link on my blog to my data and code repository (github).
