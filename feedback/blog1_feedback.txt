Feedback on scraping/data cleaning blog post:

Jackson Passey: The post looks really good, I like how succinct and laid out the steps are. 
    My one improvement for you would be to change the header photo if possible -- something 
    more related to the project like snow rather than a computer.
Response: Switched out the header photo for something more appropriate.

Nate Mohun: Looks great, my only suggestion is to increase the size of some of the images, 
    they are kind of hard to see without zooming in a bunch.
Response: Resized the images to be more readable.
