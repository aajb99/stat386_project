Feedback on dashboard:

Orion Bowers: For the dashboard, it's looking really good. It's got far more context and 
    descriptions than I gave my own. I might be ignorant, but adding what a definition of 
    SNOTEL near the top could help people like me know the signficance of their equal 
    distribution. Also, there's a few typos on the very last paragraph. Once again, well done.
Reponse: Fixed typos and looked into describing SNOTEL sites further.###################not completed###

Garrett Springer: Dashboard - Great visualizations! It looked really cool and professional. 
    Maybe for the year slider under the snowtel installment map either change it to only include 
    one year (instead of everything up to that year) or make it obvious that it is including all 
    the years up until that year.
Response: added more description to the slider tool and how it's measuring years over time.###################not completed###

Camilla McKinnon: For your dashboard - Can you add a conclusion section at the end just to really 
    drive home the key insights? You could also look into trimming down some of your explanations, 
    but other than that I think it's good. I really liked the map feature, that was fun.
Response: Looked into trimming down comments and adding more to my concluding comments.###################not completed###
