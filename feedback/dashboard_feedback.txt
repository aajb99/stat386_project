Issues with the dashboard (implementation process):

Most of the issues for my dashboard had to do with unused packages that were causing 
problems with running streamlit on the cloud. I was luckily able to resolve this.
However, there were additional issues with the presentation of my visualizations and
research findings, which were noted by those who provided me feedback (documented
below).


Feedback on dashboard (draft SHA d89e4c926fb47699d4196ecd380717bd56c46a85):

Orion Bowers: For the dashboard, it's looking really good. It's got far more context and 
    descriptions than I gave my own. I might be ignorant, but adding what a definition of 
    SNOTEL near the top could help people like me know the signficance of their equal 
    distribution. Also, there's a few typos on the very last paragraph. Once again, well done.
Reponse: Fixed typos and looked into a more in-depth reference to SNOTEL sites.

Garrett Springer: Dashboard - Great visualizations! It looked really cool and professional. 
    Maybe for the year slider under the snowtel installment map either change it to only include 
    one year (instead of everything up to that year) or make it obvious that it is including all 
    the years up until that year.
Response: added more description to the slider tool and how it's visualizing SNOTEL installments from
    years leading up to specified year.

Camilla McKinnon: For your dashboard - Can you add a conclusion section at the end just to really 
    drive home the key insights? You could also look into trimming down some of your explanations, 
    but other than that I think it's good. I really liked the map feature, that was fun.
Response: Looked into trimming down comments and making my final comment more of a "wrap up".
