# stat386_project

This repository contains the code and figures for my Utah Snow Accumulation Study.

The code includes my web scraper for data pulled from the USDA's Air and Water Database:
https://wcc.sc.egov.usda.gov/nwcc/snow-course-sites.jsp?state=UT. This can be seen in 
main.py. I also have code for my exploratory data analysis in eda.py and 
streamlit_dashboard.py.

Additional information on this study can be found on my blog at https://aajb99.github.io/
and in my streamlit dashboard at https://aajb99-utah-snow-accumulation.streamlit.app/.
